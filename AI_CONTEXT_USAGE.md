# AI Context Tracking System

This system automatically tracks AI-driven changes and maintains development context for the Rebrandly Messaging MVP project.

## 📁 Files

- **`ai-context.md`** - Main context file with deployment history
- **`update-ai-context.sh`** - Interactive bash script for manual updates
- **`auto-update-context.js`** - Automated Node.js updater for git hooks
- **`AI_CONTEXT_USAGE.md`** - This usage guide

## 🚀 Usage Methods

### Method 1: Interactive Script (Recommended)
```bash
./update-ai-context.sh
```
- Prompts for deployment information
- Guides you through the update process
- Offers automatic commit and push

### Method 2: Automated Script
```bash
# Basic usage
node auto-update-context.js

# With custom information
node auto-update-context.js \
  --userRequest "Add new feature X" \
  --keyChanges "Feature A, Bug fix B, Enhancement C" \
  --techNotes "Used new architecture pattern" \
  --autoCommit true
```

### Method 3: Manual Update
Edit `ai-context.md` directly following the established format.

## 📋 When to Update

### Automatic Updates (Recommended)
- After each deployment to main branch
- When merging feature branches
- Before sharing with stakeholders

### Manual Updates
- When making significant architectural decisions
- After major refactoring sessions
- When implementing complex features

## 🎯 Information Tracked

### Deployment Metadata
- Deployment number and timestamp
- Git branch, commit hash, and message
- Files modified and code statistics

### Development Context
- User requests and feature descriptions
- AI implementation decisions
- Technical architecture choices
- Code quality metrics

### Project Evolution
- Feature completeness tracking
- Technical debt documentation
- Future development roadmap
- Stakeholder feedback integration

## 🔧 Integration Options

### Git Hooks (Advanced)
Add to `.git/hooks/post-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" = "main" ]; then
    node auto-update-context.js --autoCommit true
fi
```

### GitHub Actions (Future)
```yaml
name: Update AI Context
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  update-context:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Update AI Context
        run: node auto-update-context.js --autoCommit true
```

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "update-context": "node auto-update-context.js",
    "deploy": "git push origin main && npm run update-context"
  }
}
```

## 📊 Benefits

### For Development
- **Context Preservation**: Never lose track of why decisions were made
- **Change Tracking**: Complete history of AI-driven modifications
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Easy onboarding for new team members
- **Decision Audit**: Review past architectural choices

### For Stakeholders
- **Transparency**: Clear view of development progress
- **Feature Tracking**: See exactly what's been implemented
- **Quality Assurance**: Evidence of systematic development approach
- **Future Planning**: Roadmap based on documented decisions

### For AI Assistance
- **Continuity**: Maintain context across sessions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from past successful approaches
- **Consistency**: Ensure architectural decisions align with history
- **Quality Control**: Track code quality metrics over time

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Sections
Edit the template in `auto-update-context.js` to include:
- Performance metrics
- Security considerations
- User feedback summaries
- Technical debt tracking

### Custom Deployment Types
Modify scripts to handle:
- Hotfix deployments
- Feature flag toggles
- Database migrations
- Infrastructure changes

## 🔍 Example Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Develop new feature on branch
2. **Test Locally**: Verify functionality works
3. **Merge to Main**: `git checkout main && git merge feature-branch`
4. **Update Context**: `./update-ai-context.sh`
5. **Deploy**: `git push origin main`
6. **Share**: Send updated prototype to stakeholders

## 📈 Metrics Tracked

### Code Quality
- Total lines of code
- File organization metrics
- Component reusability
- Documentation coverage

### Development Velocity
- Features implemented per deployment
- Time between deployments
